# Azure-Bulk-Tag-Management
This repository provides the PowerShell scripts for azure bulk tag management


Overview

This PowerShell automation consists of two scripts:
Discovery Script – Scans Azure resources and generates a CSV file listing all resources, including their tags.
Bulk Tagging Script – Reads a predefined CSV (tags.csv) and applies tag changes (addition, modification, or deletion) in bulk.

Prerequisites
PowerShell 7+ 
Azure PowerShell Module (Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber)
Required permissions to list and manage Azure resources.
CSV files:
AzureResources.csv (generated by the discovery script)


Step 1: Discovery Script

Purpose:
The discovery script scans the Azure subscription provided in the script(Subscription ), collects information on resources, and exports it to a CSV file.
script - resource.ps1(available in the repo)
run cmd - .\resourecs.ps1


Step 2: Adding tags to the generated file

We can add a new tag in new column, or modify the existing tag
If TagValue is DELETE, the script removes that tag.
Otherwise, it adds or updates the tag.


Step 3: Bulk Tagging Script

Purpose:
This script reads the AzureResource.csv file and applies tag updates to Azure resources in bulk.
script - applytags.ps1(available in the repo)
run cmd - .\applytags.ps1



How It Works:

Check for Input CSV:
Ensure the input file (AzureResources.csv) exists and isn’t empty. If it’s missing or empty, stop the script.
Read the CSV File:
Load the data from the CSV to get updated tag information.
Check Each Resource:
For each resource in the CSV:
Check if the resource exists in Azure.
Skip any resources that don't exist.
Compare Tags:
Compare the current tags on the resource with the new tags from the CSV.
If the tag needs to be updated or deleted, record the change.
Apply Changes:
Update the tags if they’ve changed.
If a tag is marked for deletion, remove it.
Log Changes:
Log every update or deletion in a separate file (Tag_Update_Log.csv) with details about what was changed, including resource ID, tag name, old and new values, and the timestamp.
Finish:
Once all resources are processed, export the change log to the output CSV file.


Key Features:
✅ Supports bulk tagging across multiple subscriptions
✅ Handles tag creation, modification, and deletion 
✅ Logs every operation with success or failure messages
